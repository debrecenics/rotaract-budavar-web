		<h3>Budapest-Budavár Rotaract Club</h3>
		<p>The Budapest-Budavár Rotaract Club was funded in 1996 as one of the first Rotaract clubs in Budapest. Rotaract members are in between the ages of 18 and 30, therefore our club had been renewed quite a few times, but we have always been organized our projects as a group of close friends and we will continue to do so in the future as well.</p>
		<p>The purpose of the club’s meetings is to provide an opportunity for club members to expand their knowledge and expertise, as well as help them in their personal development. Our common goal is to encourage our members to become sensitive to their cultural and social needs of the surrounding community as well as promote a better relationship between the peoples of the world with our aid and friendship.</p>
		<p>Good mood is very common at Rotary and Rotaract clubs beacuse of the friendship within the organization. This fact can be fully said about the Budapest-Budavár Rotaract Club as well as we try to involve every newcomer in all the team buildings and all the projects we have at the time.</p>
		<p>If you would like join us and do something good for the community and for yourself under the flag of Budapest-Budavar, in addition to all of this be part of a friendly environment, contact us or visit one of our meetings.</p>
